   I am a second year PhD student at <b>Rochester Institute of Technology</b> in Rochester, New York. My current research involves investigating 
   dynamic stiffening and softening in colloidal networks. I am working with Dr. Moumita Das in the Mathematical Modelling department of my university.
   <br>Prior to joining my current school, I was a student at <b>Texas A&M University-Commerce</b> where I pursued a <b>Bachelor of Science </b>
   in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science. I try my best to keep my personal website current. However, below is a link to my LinkedIn page 
   in case one is interested in more details of my research and experience done in Texas.
