                      <p>My current role is a<b>Graduate Research Assistant</b> at the</p><p>My research consists of investigating colloidal networks as a model system that can dynamically switch between crosslinked and unlinked states via crosslinkers.</p>
                      <p>We also use Brownian Dynamics simulations and analyzing properties, such as the degree order in the
system, connected clusters size, and the mechanical rigidity of the system as a function of time for
                        different volume fractions of colloids and crosslinking kinetics.</p>
                      <p>Our results can provide insights into the design of self-sustaining soft materials that can autonomously
transition between solid-like and 
uid-like states, and how the properties of such materials can be tuned.</p>

                      <p>My work Used Elsevier Knowledge Graph database to build known interactions reported to linking cytokines. It also Encoded set of ordinary differential equations characterizing concentration patterns of main cytokines</p>
                      <p> In this work system parameters were estimated using partial least squares (PLS) to mitigate instability on coeffcient
values that resulted from collinearity between regressor variables</p>

cytokines IL2, IL7, and MCP1 separate patient exacerbation levels within infrequent episodes</p>
